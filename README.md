# Arduino-SOS
Prerequisite project one

For this project I used an arduino and an LED to flash SOS in morse code. This was accoplished by having the led blink three dots
signaling an 'S', three dashes signaling an 'O', and then three more dots for the final 'S'. A dot was a half second blind and a dash is 3x 
the length of a dot, so 1.5 seconds.
